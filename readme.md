# Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

# Note

- `integration-test-profile`: When activated, this profile skips unit tests executed by the maven-surefire-plugin and instead starts a PostgreSQL Docker container using the docker-maven-plugin for running integration tests, end-to-end tests, and end-to-end tests with Cucumber via the maven-failsafe-plugin. To activate this profile, use the following command: 

    `mvn verify -Pintegration-test-profile -Dpostgres.user=$USER -Dpostgres.password=$PASSWORD -Dpostgres.dbName=$DATABASE -Dpostgres.server=maven`. 

Ensure that `postgres.server` is set to `maven`; otherwise, the Docker container will fail to establish a connection, and the tests will start Testcontainers in parallel for testing.

# Overview

This project report details the creation of a software application utilizing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture and incorporating the repository pattern through **Test-Driven Development**, alongside **Build Automation** and **Continuous Integration**. This project utilizes the tools and techniques described in the book "Test-Driven Development, Build Automation, Continuous Integration with Java, Eclipse and Friends" by Professor **Lorenzo Bettini**. The primary objective was to develop a robust, easily maintainable, and scalable application using modern development practices and tools. The project uses a range of technologies like **Eclipse, Maven, Docker, GitHub Actions**, and **SonarCloud**. It emphasizes thorough testing through **white-box (unit and integration tests)** and **black-box (end-to-end tests)** testing methodologies.

The **"Order Worker Management System"** facilitates the management of orders and workers, establishing relationships between them through **one-to-one** and **one-to-many** connections. Each order can be assigned to a single worker, while a worker may handle multiple orders. However, certain criteria govern the interaction between orders and workers:

- **Order and worker categories must align** (e.g., both categorized as "Electrician").
- **Orders are initiated with a "pending" status**.
- **An order cannot be assigned to a worker if the worker already has a pending order**.

The main features of the project include **adding, updating, fetching, and deleting orders and workers**. Additionally, it offers a **search function with multiple options** such as ID, name, phone number, etc.

## Primary Code Structure:
The code is organized into **models, views, controllers, repositories, utilities, enumerations**, and the **main class** along with resources directory. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:
### Java Code Structure:
#### Main Class:
**OrderWorkerAssignmentSwingApp** is the main class of the project. To run the main method, you must provide command line arguments for database configuration (user, password, host, database, port, etc.). If not provided, default values will be used, and the database connection may fail. Notably, the password value must be provided as it was removed by SonarCloud for security reasons.

#### Enumerations:
- **OrderCategory**: Used in Worker and CustomerOrder models for assigning categories.
- **OrderStatus**: Used in CustomerOrder model to assign each order a status.
- **OperationType**: Used in the controller for adding or updating, as the same method handles both operations.
- **OrderSearchOptions**: Used for searching orders in the repository and controller.
- **WorkerSearchOptions**: Used for searching workers in the repository and controller.

#### Models: (Entities Used in the project)
##### Worker

###### Attributes
- **Worker Id**: Auto-incrementing primary key for worker
- **Worker Name**: Name of the worker
- **Worker Phone Number**: Unique phone number of the worker
- **Worker Category**: Category of the worker, data type is `OrderCategory`
- **List of Customer Orders**: List of orders handled by the worker

###### Enumerations
- **OrderCategory**: Enumeration for categorizing workers

###### Relationships
- **WorkerId** is the auto-incrementing primary key for worker
- A worker can handle multiple orders (One to many relation)
- A worker cannot be assigned a new order if they have a pending one
- Worker phone numbers are unique

##### Customer Order

###### Attributes
- **Order Id**: Auto-incrementing primary key for CustomerOrder
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer
- **Customer Address**: Address of the customer
- **Customer Phone Number**: Phone number of the customer
- **AppointmentDate**: Date of the appointment
- **Order Description**: Description of the order
- **Order Category**: Category of the order, data type is `OrderCategory`
- **Order Status**: Status of the order, data type is `OrderStatus`
- **Worker**: The worker assigned to the order

###### Enumerations
- **OrderCategory**: Enumeration for categorizing orders
- **OrderStatus**: Enumeration for order status

###### Relationships
- **OrderId** is the auto-incrementing primary key for CustomerOrder
- Each order can have only one worker (One to one relation)
- Orders are initiated with a "pending" status
- Orders and worker categories must align (e.g., both categorized as "Electrician")

#### Repositories: (Database Repository)

##### Interfaces
- **OrderRepository**
- **WorkerRepository**

##### Java Classes Implementing Repositories
- **OrderDataRepository**
- **WorkerDataRepository**

#### Views: 

##### Interfaces
- **OrderView**
- **WorkerView**

##### JFrame Classes Implementing Views
- **OrderSwingView**  (`JFrame` class implementing OrderView)
- **WorkerSwingView** (`JFrame` class implementing WorkerView)

#### Utils
The utils include an interface and a Java class that implements this interface. The `Worker` and `CustomerOrder` models contain some common fields that require validation in multiple places, such as validating an ID when adding or deleting an entity in the controller, therefore common validations are not part of the controller or model. To handle these common validations, methods are defined in the `ValidationConfigurations` interface. The design is loosely coupled, allowing for flexibility and interchangeability of implementations. Additionally, the use of dependency injection ensures that `ValidationConfigurations` can be easily integrated and utilized, especially when injecting mocks, ensuring consistent validation across different parts of the application.
##### Interface: 
**ValidationConfigurations**
##### Java Class Implementing Interface: 
`ExtendedValidationConfigurations` (implements ValidationConfigurations)

#### Controllers
This Controller class accepts **Repository, View, and ValidationConfigurations** interfaces in the constructor, promoting loose coupling and dependency injection. This design allows any class implementing these interfaces to be assigned seamlessly. The controller uses **Log4j** for logging, with the resource files located in **src/main/resources** and **src/test/resources**.

##### WorkerController: 
Accepts **WorkerView, WorkerRepository, and ValidationConfigurations** as parameters.
##### OrderController: 
Accepts **OrderRepository, OrderView, WorkerRepository, and ValidationConfigurations** as parameters.

### Resources Code Structure:
This directory has only 1 file named **log4j2.xml** responsible for showing logs while running main code. While the **persistence.xml** file is not part of GitHub repository since it is sensitive file therefore main method accepts arguments and provide these arguments to entity manager factory as properties for database connection.

## Test Code, Resource structure & Strategies:

This project is developed using **Test Driven Development (TDD)** while adhering to the **Test Pyramid**. It includes three types of tests: **unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests**. In this project, I demonstrate two types of end-to-end tests: one using JUnit with AssertJ, and the other using Cucumber in a BDD (Behavior Driven Development) style. For a better understanding of these tests, please refer to the header comments in each test file.
### Test Resource structure:

This directory has 2 files: one for logs **log4j2.xml** responsible for showing logs while running tests. The other file is **persistence.xml** which holds the configuration for the database which is later used by JPA during **IT tests and End-to-End tests along with Unit tests for database repository**.

### Testing strategy for Unit tests:
Unit tests consist of five types: **utils tests, controller tests, repository tests, Swing view tests, and race condition tests**. Each test follows a structured approach with three main phases: **Setup, Exercise, and Verify**. Additionally, I've included a fourth phase, **Mocks**, to improve the readability of the tests. All these tests achieve **100% code coverage** with no surviving mutants.
#### Utils Unit Tests: 
The **Utils** unit tests were the first tests I wrote using **TDD** and the **Transformation Priority Premise**. This is because the **Utils** class is responsible for validating everything in the project. These tests verify each validate method in the **SUT ExtendedValidationConfigurations**. The **Utils** tests include unit tests for all validation methods in **ExtendedValidationConfigurations**, utilizing the **AssertJ** library.

#### Controller Unit Tests:
**Controller tests** include unit tests for both the **worker and order controllers** using the **Mockito** library. The **OrderControllerTest** and **WorkerController Test** class has the **SUT** as **OrderController** and **WorkerController** respectively with mocked dependencies such as **OrderRepository, WorkerRepository, OrderView, WorkerRepository, WorkerView, and ValidationConfigurations**. These tests verify whether the controller calls the corresponding view method when a controller method is invoked.

#### Swing View Unit Tests: 

**Swing view tests** include unit tests for both **order and worker Swing JFrame

 views**, utilizing the **AssertJ, Mockito, and AssertJSwingJUnitTestCase** libraries. These tests verify several aspects, including initial state verifications of labels, text fields, combo boxes, and buttons, as well as the enabling and disabling of the **Add, Update, Fetch, Search, Delete, and Clear** buttons based on user input. They also ensure proper delegation of user actions to the **OrderController and WorkerController** for tasks such as adding, updating, fetching, searching, and deleting orders. Additionally, these tests confirm the correct display of orders and workers in UI components like lists and combo boxes, and the appropriate showing of error messages in the error labels.

#### Repository Unit Tests: 
Unit tests for the **worker and order database repositories** use the **H2 in-memory database** with **PostgreSQLDialect**, as there is no PostgreSQL Java driver similar to the Mongo Java Driver described in the book. These tests utilize the **persistence.xml** file located in the tests/resource directory for configuration. However, the rest of the information for the **H2 database** is provided in the **@Before** method of the test class as properties to the entity manager factory. These tests then use a local database to mimic a real PostgreSQL database. They verify all **CRUD operations**, along with other search methods and behaviors of the database on these inputs.

#### Race Condition Unit Tests: 
**OrderControllerRaceConditionTest** and **WorkerControllerRaceConditionTest**: These tests ensure the **OrderController** and **WorkerController** functions correctly in concurrent environments, verifying that the application handles race conditions properly when multiple threads access and modify order and worker data simultaneously. The tests use **Mockito** for mocking dependencies and **Awaitility** for handling asynchronous operations. The methods tested include **createOrUpdateOrder()** and **createOrUpdateWorker()** for concurrent order and worker creation, respectively, and **deleteOrder()** and **deleteWorker()** for concurrent order and worker deletion.

### Testing strategy for Integration and End-to-End Tests:
The most crucial component in the **integration tests directory** is the **DatabaseConfig** Java class. This class is essential because the project offers two methods for starting PostgreSQL Docker containers: one with **test containers** and the other **without test containers**, directly starting a PostgreSQL Docker container. The first method is useful for starting the Docker container during development using an **IDE like Eclipse**, while the second method is beneficial for running integration tests and end-to-end tests with a **Maven profile**. The **DatabaseConfig** Java class is vital because it is located in the integration tests directory, yet end-to-end tests also utilize this class for database configuration. This setup ensures code duplication is avoided. This project includes two types of end-to-end tests: one set using **JUnit with AssertJ**, and the other using **Cucumber in a BDD (Behavior Driven Development) style**. Both sets cover the same test scenarios. These tests include setting up and tearing down the test environment using Docker containers and database configurations.

#### Integration tests:
Integration tests are divided into four types: **controller, MVC, race condition, and view integration tests**. 

##### Controller IT Tests: 
These tests verify the integration between the **OrderController** and **WorkerController** and their respective dependencies, including **OrderRepository, WorkerRepository, OrderView, WorkerView**, and **ValidationConfigurations**. The tests cover various scenarios such as creating, updating, fetching, deleting, and searching orders and workers. These tests verify that when a controller method is called, it correctly displays or modifies data in the view.

##### View IT Tests: 
Integration tests for the **OrderSwingView** and **WorkerSwingView** classes cover a range of functionalities. They ensure the correct operation of creating, updating, fetching, searching, and deleting customer orders and workers through the graphical user interface. The tests verify both successful and failed operations for these actions, ensuring proper validation and error handling for invalid input data. Additionally, the tests utilize the **AssertJSwingJUnitTestCase** framework for GUI testing and **Awaitility** for asynchronous operations.

##### Model View Controller IT Tests: 
Integration tests for the **OrderModelViewControllerIT** and **WorkerModelViewControllerIT** classes verify the integration between their respective controllers (**OrderController** and **WorkerController**), views (**OrderSwingView** and **WorkerSwingView**), and underlying repositories. These tests cover scenarios such as adding, updating, fetching, and deleting orders and workers. They utilize **AssertJ Swing** for GUI testing to ensure that the user interface behaves correctly and interacts properly with the controllers and repositories.

##### Race Condition IT Tests: 
Integration tests for the **OrderController** and **WorkerController** classes focus on race conditions, ensuring proper functionality in concurrent environments. These tests verify that the application correctly handles race conditions when multiple threads are accessing and modifying order and worker data simultaneously. Specifically, for the **OrderController**, the tests cover accessing and deleting order data, while for the **WorkerController**, they cover accessing, adding, and deleting worker data. The tests utilize **Awaitility** for managing asynchronous operations, ensuring robust and reliable performance under concurrent conditions.

#### End-To-End tests (JUnit):
These tests use the same **DatabaseConfig** Java class for database connections, as defined in the testing strategy for integration tests. These tests involve interactions with the **Order and Worker views**, such as adding, updating, fetching, searching, and deleting orders and workers. It is important to note that the **Order View Form** and **Worker View Form** are not tested together in previous tests such as integration or unit tests. Since this is an end-to-end test, the focus is on verifying the interaction between the two. The tests verify the correct display of database records in the GUI and ensure proper handling of various operations. Additionally, they ensure appropriate error handling and validation for both orders and workers. The tests utilize the **AssertJSwingJUnitTestCase** framework for GUI testing, **Awaitility** for asynchronous operations, and **persistence** for database operations. Runs all **Model, View, Controller, Repository**, and **Utils** tests, along with testing functionality that integrates both worker and order views together.

#### End-To-End tests (Cucumber):
These tests also utilize the same **DatabaseConfig** Java class and a **ConfigSteps** file in **bdd/java** for database connections. They are end-to-end tests, covering the same scenarios as the JUnit end-to-end tests but are written to demonstrate **Cucumber**. The tests are organized into two directories: one for features, located in **bdd/resources**, and the other for the primary test code, located in **bdd/java**. The directory is named **BDD** because these tests are written in the **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)** format. Runs all **Model, View, Controller, Repository**, and **Utils** tests, along with testing functionality that integrates both worker and order views together using features written in **Gherkin**, and executed with **Cucumber** in a **BDD (Behavior Driven Development) style**.

- **Docker maven plugin**: Manages Docker containers and images.

### Profiles:
This project consists of **4 profiles**. 
#### Jacoco profile:
This profile runs unit tests with coverage excluding models and the main class **(OrderWorkerAssignmentSwingApp)**. It utilizes the **JaCoCo** plugin, which operates on the **prepare-agent** and **report** goals. The **prepare-agent** goal sets up the JaCoCo agent to collect coverage data during the test phase, while the **report** goal generates a code coverage report after the tests have run. This profile is specifically created for the **SonarCloud** workflow, which will be discussed later.

#### Mutation-testing-with-coverage Profile:
This profile runs the **JaCoCo** plugin with the same configuration as mentioned above,

 along with the **Coveralls** plugin, which is responsible for uploading the coverage report generated by JaCoCo to the **Coveralls** website. By binding the **verify** phase with the **report** goals, **Coveralls** ensures the report is generated after all tests have run, and the **report** goal generates and sends the report to the **Coveralls** website. Additionally, this profile runs the **PIT mutation** plugin, but only on **controller and utils unit tests**, with **strong mutators** and a **100% mutation threshold**.

#### Integration-test-profile:
This profile skips unit tests run by the **Surefire** plugin. The **docker-maven-plugin** starts the Docker container with a predefined port, but other arguments such as user, password, and database are taken from properties that can be updated during runtime. The Docker container will start before integration tests and stop after completing all integration and end-to-end tests, as this plugin is bound to the **pre-integration-test** and **post-integration-test** phases with start and stop goals respectively. The database connection is checked programmatically by each test before running.

The **Failsafe** plugin in this profile has three executions: one for **integration tests**, one for **JUnit end-to-end tests**, and one for **Cucumber end-to-end tests**. This plugin is responsible for running these tests and generating reports, utilizing its two goals: **integration-test** and **verify**.

#### Generate_fat_jar_profile: 
This profile skips unit tests and generates a fat jar using the **maven-assembly-plugin**.

# Database Implementation:
The database used in this project is **PostgreSQL**, which utilizes an **EntityManagerFactory** to establish connections. The connection requires a **persistence.xml** file that contains all the database configuration details, such as entities annotated in the models. The **EntityManagerFactory** accepts properties that override those in the **persistence.xml** file if duplicated.

This project has a single **persistence.xml** file located in **test/resources** that holds the database configuration. However, the user, database, and password details in this file are taken from **pom.xml** properties, which are also used by the **docker-maven-plugin** to start Docker containers. Therefore, when running the **integration test profile**, both the Docker container and **persistence.xml** will use the same credentials. In some cases, such as database repository unit tests, the **persistence.xml** needs to update certain details such as **JDBC URL, user, and password at runtime**. These updates are provided by passing properties to the **EntityManagerFactory**.

Since **integration** and **End-to-End tests** need to run both locally and in workflows, I have divided the database setup into two types: one with a profile and one without. Running the project with the profile ensures that both the project and Docker container use the configuration in the **pom.xml** file. Running the project without the profile starts the **test containers**, which use constant variables for configuration, updating properties dynamically and not relying on **pom.xml** properties because the host and port of these test containers can change.

To solve this problem, I created a **DBConfig** interface with three methods, implemented in two files: **MavenContainerConfig** and **TestContainerConfig**.

- **testAndStartDatabaseConnection**: If the project runs without a profile, this method starts the test container. If it runs with a profile, it starts the Docker container without test containers and tries to connect to the database until successful.

- **getEntityManagerFactory**: This method provides the **EntityManagerFactory** for all tests. If the project runs without a profile, it updates the **persistence.xml** configuration using properties generated by test containers. If it runs with a profile, it uses the default **persistence.xml** configuration.

- **startApplication**: This method is only for End-to-End tests. If the project starts without a profile, it passes arguments to the main class configured with **Picocli** using test container configurations. If started with a profile, it uses the default **persistence.xml** configuration from **pom.xml** properties.

# Github action workflows & Sonar Cloud:
There are four **GitHub Action workflows** defined in the **.github/workflows** directory. Each workflow follows a common set of steps: it first downloads cached dependencies, then runs tests with various configurations, and finally generates reports that are stored as artifacts. These workflows require sensitive information, such as tokens, which are securely stored in **GitHub Secrets**. Only the secret variables are used in the workflows. Every workflow has a badge which can be seen in **readme.md** file. **Sonar cloud** and **coverall badge** is also embedded in the **readme.md** file by clicking which you can see reports on their respective websites.

## Sonar cloud:
The project is available on the **SonarCloud** website, accessible via the badge in the **README.md** file. Below is a summary of the code on the **main branch**. In the properties section of the **pom.xml** file, there are ignored rules along with coverage exclusion for models and the main class **(OrderWorkerAssignmentSwingApp)**. The **SonarCloud** plugin is utilized in the **"Java CI with Maven, Docker, and SonarCloud in Linux"** workflow, which employs **Java 17** due to issues encountered when running this workflow with **Java 11**. However, **SonarCloud** was operational with **Java 8** and **11** when using the local **Sonar Docker container**, which can be run with the **docker-compose.yml** file in the project.
### Sonar Cloud Ignored Rules (False positives):
- The use of static access with **"javax.swing.WindowConstants"** for **"EXIT_ON_CLOSE"** in all Java classes was ignored because it is auto-generated by Windows Builder.
- The rule **"Constructor has X parameters, which is greater than Y authorized"** was ignored in all Java classes due to the code being generated by Windows Builder and models.
- The warning **"Add at least one assertion to this test case"** was ignored in **OrderSwingViewTest** and **WorkerSwingViewTest** since **SonarQube** does not recognize that these **AssertJ Swing** methods effectively assert.
- The recommendation to **"Rename this field like CUSTOMER_PHONE_1 to match the regular expression"** was ignored because the current naming provides more readability in the tests.
- The suggestion to **"Rename class OrderWorkerSwingAppE2E to match the regular expression"** was ignored in the **OrderWorkerSwingAppE2E** test class.
- The advice to **"Replace these 3 tests with a single Parameterized one"** in the **ExtendedValidationConfigurations** class was ignored as it warns that three methods should be merged into one.
